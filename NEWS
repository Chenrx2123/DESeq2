CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Base class: SummarizedExperiment is used as the superclass 
      for storing the data.

    o Workflow: The wrapper function DESeq() performs all steps 
      for a differential expression analysis. Individual steps are 
      still accessible.

    o Statistics: Incorporation of prior distributions into the 
      estimation of dispersions and fold changes (empirical-Bayes 
      shrinkage). A Wald test for significance is provided as the 
      default inference method, with the chi-squared test of the 
      previous version also available.

    o Normalization: it is possible to provide a matrix of sample- 
      *and* gene-specific normalization factors
